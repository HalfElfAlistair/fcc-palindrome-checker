## Introduction

Made as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. (for the purposes of this repo I've changed it to display a message in HTML instead).

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".


### Personal Aims

Succesfully solve the JavaScript challenge.

Convert the code from my completed challenge so that it works with a HTML page.

Improve my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript.

Have a project I can go back and refactor as I progress, for shorter code that's easier to understand.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Node.js

- Chrome Devtools

- FCC Console

I developed the JS code in on FCC for the challenge, then used VSC to amend it and add it to HTML.

## Author Notes

I feel I've written better code with this project than the Roman Numeral Converter that I finished first. It could be that this challenge was easier though, not sure.

Of course it's still not perfect and I'll refactor in the future to make it better.

I've definitely improved my knowledge with this one which is the most important thing.
